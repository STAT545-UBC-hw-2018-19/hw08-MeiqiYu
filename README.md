HW08-Meiqiyu
================

This repo is the Hw08 for STAT547M. In this assignment, I added some
extra features to BC Liquor shiny app and deployed it.

# Quick Link

Here is the [link](https://maggieyumq.shinyapps.io/bcl_meiqiyu/) of my
shiny app.

Here is the
[link](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-MeiqiYu/blob/master/bcl_meiqiyu/app.R)
of the R code.

# Feaures I added

  - Add an image of the BC Liquor Store.

  - Show the number of results found whenever users change the filters.

  - Return NULL if the number of rows is 0.

  - Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an
    interactive table.

  - Place the plot and the table in separate tabs.

  - Add a radio button to sort by price, alcohol content or sweetness.

  - Allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types simultaneously,
    instead of being able to choose only wines/beers/etc.
